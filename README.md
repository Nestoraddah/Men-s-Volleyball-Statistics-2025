# Men's Volleyball Statistics
This project analyzed 2025 NAIA Menâ€™s Volleyball statistics to uncover key performance trends across players and conferences. Using Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib), the data was cleaned, standardized, and segmented by conference for accurate comparison. Visual analyses identified top players in key metrics, including points per set, hitting percentage, digs, and blocks. The study revealed differences in offensive and defensive strengths among conferences, highlighting how data analytics can enhance coaching strategy and player evaluation. The project demonstrates the integration of statistical analysis and sports insight to drive informed, performance-based decision-making within collegiate volleyball.
